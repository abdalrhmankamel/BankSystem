## Bank System Project


This project is a simple banking system built using C++ , ConsoleApplication .
It includes several key components: a user management system for handling clients,
a transaction system to transfer funds between accounts,
validation checks to ensure transfers meet certain criteria,
user management (creation and administration of accounts), 
and currency management for handling exchange rates.

Thanks for see it
